I created this game in Year13 for my OCR A-Level Computer Science project using PyGame in which I achieved 69/70 in (A*)!
Prior to making this game I had to do a lot of planning and research on existing games. I made many flow diagrams, top down modular diagrams and even interviewed my stakeholders.
I used concepts of OOP and inheritance which I had learnt in school to create a 2D platformer game from scratch!
This game includes various features such as: a leaderboard, character selection, sound effects, settings + instruction screens, animations, dyslexia-friendly font text and multiple levels.
Since there was no up-to-date and reliable PyGame library to play GIFS, I had to figure out how to do my animations another way. So I split my animation frames into separate images and put them in a list which I constantly iterated through upon certain condiitons being met, e.g. the character moving left.
I initially wanted to make this game 2-player, however, due to time restraints I could not.
As this is my first game my code isn't quite efficient and I would change how I coded a few things, for example, instead of importing each individual sprite image separately I would have just imported the files from the folder which would have been more quicker.
